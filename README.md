ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
ðŸ“˜ Objective

The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica â€” based on the measurements of their petals and sepals.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
 or sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Target: Species of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

ðŸš€ Steps Followed

Data Loading & Exploration:
Loaded the Iris dataset and explored data distributions using scatter plots and histograms.

Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

Preprocessing:
The dataset is already clean, but scaling or normalization can be applied if required.

Model Training:
Implemented and trained simple classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ§  Skills Gained

Numeric data analysis

Classification modeling

Data visualization

Model evaluation and interpretation

ðŸ“§ Spam Mail Detector
ðŸ“˜ Objective

The aim of this project is to build a text classification model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages based on their content.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source:

SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI)

or Enron Email Dataset

Data:

Text messages or emails

Labels: spam or ham

ðŸš€ Steps Followed

Data Loading:
Imported the dataset containing messages and their labels.

Text Preprocessing:

Converted text to lowercase

Removed punctuation and stopwords

Tokenized and cleaned the text

Feature Extraction:
Transformed text into numeric vectors using:

Bag of Words (BoW)

or TF-IDF representation

Data Splitting:
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training:
Trained machine learning models such as:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

ðŸ§  Skills Gained
